# <https://github.com/atweiden/dotfiles/blob/master/.inputrc>

# include any distro default settings
$include /etc/inputrc

# use vi mode
set editing-mode vi
set keymap vi

# allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like
# $'\0123\0456'
set input-meta on
set output-meta on
set convert-meta off

# display possible completions according to $LC_COLORS
set colored-stats on

# auto completion ignores case
set completion-ignore-case on

# only display 3 characters of the common prefix in the completion
set completion-prefix-display-length 3

# display a / after any symlinked directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# don't ring the bell, but instead show the completions immediately
set show-all-if-ambiguous on
set show-all-if-unmodified on

# append completions by characters that indicate their file type according to 
# stat
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text
# after the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd
# ~/src/mozil", and the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not
# autocomplete it to "cd ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla".
# (This is supported by the Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on
